\section*{MBSS\_PieChart.py}
\subsection*{Aim}
MBSS\_PieChart.py is a python3 script that is designed to represent the final probability distribution 
of each state present in the probtraj\_table.csv file generated by MBSS\_FormatTable.pl. The output is a pie chart. 

\subsection*{How to run the script}
The user should be in the same directory in which he or she ran MBSS\_FormatTable.pl. MBSS\_PieChart.py can be run using the following command line: 
\begin{verbatim}
MBSS_PieChart.py folder_name
\end{verbatim}
A help command line is also available:
\begin{verbatim} 
MBSS_PieChart.py help
\end{verbatim}
The following libraries need to be installed:
\begin{verbatim}
pandas
matplotlib.pylab
sys
matplotlib
xlsxwriter
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib.patches
matplotlib.gridspec
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Outputs}
The figure will be saved as folder\_name\_chart.pdf. Only the states present with a final probability higher than $0.1$ will have their name on the 
chart. All the state names are displayed as legend with the associated color.
Data describing the final state represented by the chart is also saved as folder\_name\_traj.xlsx.
