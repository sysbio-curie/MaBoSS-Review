\subsection*{Aim}
MBSS\_TrajectoryFig.py is a python3 script that is designed to represent the probability evolution of each model state present in the probtraj\_table.csv file generated by MBSS\_FormatTable.pl. 

\subsection*{How to run the script}
The user should be in the same directory in which he or she ran MBSS\_FormatTable.pl. MBSS\_TrajectoryFig.py can be run using the following command line: 
\begin{verbatim}
MBSS_TrajectoryFig.py folder_name
\end{verbatim}
 A help command line is also available:
\begin{verbatim} 
MBSS_TrajectoryFig.py help
\end{verbatim}
The following libraries need to be installed:
\begin{verbatim}
pandas
matplotlib.pylab
sys
matplotlib
xlsxwriter
numpy
seaborn
\end{verbatim}


\subsection*{Outputs}
The figure will be saved as folder\_name\_traj.pdf.
The data used to generate the plot will be saved as folder\_name\_traj.xlsx
